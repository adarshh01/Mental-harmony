            What Exactly is a Mental Illness
          </h1>
          <p>
            A mental illness is a physical illness of the brain that causes
            disturbances in thinking, behavior, energy or emotion that make it
            difficult to cope with the ordinary demands of life. Research is
            starting to uncover the complicated causes of these diseases which
            can include genetics, brain chemistry, brain structure, experiencing
            trauma and/or having another medical condition, like heart disease.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the general perception of mental illness has improved
            over the past decades, studies show that stigma against mental
            illness is still powerful, largely due to media stereotypes and lack
            of education, and that people tend to attach negative stigmas to
            mental health conditions at a far higher rate than to other diseases
            and disabilities, such as cancer, diabetes or heart disease.;
          </p>
          <h3 id="quisque-mauris-lorem">How common are mental illnesses?</h3>
          <p>
			Mental illnesses are among the most common health conditions in the United States.

			More than 50% will be diagnosed with a mental illness or disorder at some point in their lifetime.
			 
			 
			 
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>1 in 5 Americans will experience a mental illness in a given year.</li>
            <li>1 in 5 children, either currently or at some point during their life, have had a seriously debilitating mental illness.</li>
            <li>
				1 in 25 Americans lives with a serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression.</li>
             
				
				
            
            
          </ul>
		  <h3 id="quisque-mauris-lorem">What causes mental illness?</h3>
				<p>
					There is no single cause for mental illness. A number of factors can contribute to risk for mental illness, such as
				  </p>
				  <li>Early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse (for example, child abuse, sexual assault, witnessing violence, etc.)</li>
				  <li>Experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes</li>
				  <li>Biological factors or chemical imbalances in the brain</li>
				  <li>Use of alcohol or drugs</li>
				  <li>Having feelings of loneliness or isolation</li>
				  <h3 id="quisque-mauris-lorem">Can your mental health change over time?</h3>
		  <p>
			Yes, it’s important to remember that a person’s mental health can change over time, depending on many factors.  When the demands placed on a person exceed their resources and coping abilities, their mental health could be impacted. For example, if someone is working long hours, caring for a relative, or experiencing economic hardship, they may experience poor mental health.
